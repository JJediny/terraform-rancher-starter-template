# Files

Terraform will read all files from the same folder and allow the resources and variables to cross reference.

This is a reference from the work done by aemneina/terraform-aws-rancher-ha and mlaccetti/terraform-aws-rancher-ha.
Just wrapped it up in a beginnings of a module thats not too abstract to understand.

variables.tf stores all variables that are used.
